title: Hello world!
---

After some time working as a Database Developer, I realized there are many concepts that although I understand, I never got to implement them.
A lot of these are fundamental, and used every day in database systems.

I also know that my writing has never been really good (maybe you already noticed that). Writing texts has always been a chore to me since when I had to do this at school.

To remedy both of these issues, I decided to not only implement the algorithms, but also write about them. Hopefully this allows me to understand things better, improve my writing skills, and maybe, just maybe, also help you understand new stuff.

For my initial project I will look into the MVCC algorithm proposed by Thomas Neumann at SIGMOD 2015 ([paper](https://db.in.tum.de/~muehlbau/papers/mvcc.pdf)). MVCC is used to control access to tuples when multiple transactions are being executed. We will see more about it on the next post.

All the best, and hope to see you soon!
