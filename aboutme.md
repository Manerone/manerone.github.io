My name is Matheus Nerone, I have a bachelor in Computer Science at UFPR, and MsC in Database Systems at UFPR. I was a PhD candidate for four year at CWI-DA at Amsterdam until eventually quitted it and started to work with database development.

I am interested in everything in computer science, so if you feel like sharing please, lets talk :smile:
